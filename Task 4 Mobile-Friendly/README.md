# Responsive_Blog — Everyday Learnings

This repository contains a small responsive blog project created for **Web Development Internship — Task 4**.

## What I built
- A single-page blog layout (`index.html`) with three sample posts.
- A clean, **flat** (no gradients) informal design using a teal/orange accent palette.
- Responsive CSS in `style.css` with breakpoints at **1024px** and **768px**.
- Mobile navigation uses a simple checkbox "hamburger" (CSS-first) to toggle the menu for small screens.
- Images are in `/images` (placeholders included).

## How it meets the task objectives
- Media queries target `max-width: 768px` to stack content vertically and adapt font sizes.
- Navigation collapses on small screens and expands on desktop.
- Images use `object-fit: cover` and scale to the container width to avoid overflow.
- No external libraries or paid tools were used — everything is pure HTML/CSS (small inline JS not required).

## How to view
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Use Chrome DevTools device toolbar or resize the window to test responsiveness (<=768px stacks layout).

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — stylesheet with media queries
- `images/` — sample images (placeholders)
- `README.md` — this file
